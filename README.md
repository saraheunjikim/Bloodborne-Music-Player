## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
First, I created the interface using Tkinter and tried to get one music played. After I made the music to play, I worked on adding another music. Then, I needed to make it stop when I press the STOP button. Or pause the music when I press the PAUSE button. Lastly, I made the music to play again once the music ended.</p>
<p>
  

### Lesson Learned
<p>
Using a PyGame to play music was tricky. For some reason, the music was not playing at all, so I had to research for hours and ask questions to fix the problem. I wish I could have used a different library, but I could not find a better alternative to PyGame at the time. Maybe the next time, I will try other libraries. Also, changing a button when the music is playing was challenging.

  <p>
I learned that understanding the problem is very important. For example, if I don't understand the error, I will never be able to fix the error.
